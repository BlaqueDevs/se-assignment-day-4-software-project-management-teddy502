Resource Intensive:
Agile requires ongoing engagement from all stakeholders, which can be demanding in terms of time and effort.
Potential for Scope Creep:
Without strong project management, the flexibility in Agile can sometimes lead to uncontrolled scope expansion.
Documentation May Suffer:
The focus on rapid iterations can result in less comprehensive documentation compared to Waterfall, which might affect long-term maintainability.
Summary
## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
Agile works best for projects that are dynamic and require flexibility. For example, a startup developing a mobile app or an e-commerce platform would benefit from Agile, as frequent user feedback and rapid iterations allow the team to adapt quickly to changing market needs. In these environments, requirements can evolve as the product matures, making Agile's iterative cycles ideal.

Conversely, Waterfall is more beneficial in projects where requirements are well-defined and unlikely to change. Consider a government contract for a regulatory compliance system or the development of embedded software for a medical device. In these cases, the project's scope, specifications, and regulatory needs are clearly defined from the outset, so a sequential, documentation-heavy Waterfall approach ensures thorough planning and minimizes risk.
